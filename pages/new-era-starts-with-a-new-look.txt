<p>
After too many years of neglecting this site, today, finally I rebuilt it with brand new technology behind it.
Not only that, but I've decided to make the whole back-end open source and put the source code on 
<a href="https://github.com/szabgab/tracert.com">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
This includes the list of all the tracerute sites, all the ping site and everything.
</p>

<p>
That means, if you find another site that should be included in the list, or if you find that something is broken
on the web site, you can open an <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/tracert.com/issues">issue</a>, or you can
even send a pull request fixing it.
